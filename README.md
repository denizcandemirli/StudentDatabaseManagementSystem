# Student Database Management System

## Overview
The Student Database Management System is a RESTful API designed to efficiently manage student data within an educational institution. Built with Node.js and Express, this system allows for easy creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD) of student records. It provides a robust and scalable solution for handling student information, ensuring data integrity and security.

## Features
- **Add New Students**: Easily add new student records to the database with relevant details such as name, age, class, and contact information.
- **Retrieve Student Information**: Quickly retrieve detailed information about individual students or a list of all students.
- **Update Records**: Modify existing student data to keep information up-to-date.
- **Delete Students**: Remove student records from the database when no longer needed.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for students based on various criteria.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that all student data is accurate and complete before it is added to the database.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: A powerful JavaScript runtime used for building the server-side application.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store student records, ensuring high performance and scalability.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straightforward schema-based solution to model application data.
